# Pfaffhack_PfaffRunner
## Our project for Fraunhofer's Hackathon 2022

We won 1st place with our prototype, which was designed from scratch within 24 hours.

Our idea was to develop a gamified app to increase the movement of the residents of Pfaffquartier. In addition, kinetic plates should be used to produce electricity at the same time. Everyone should be able to see how much electricity they have generated and collect points that can be redeemed for rewards.

Our pitch is included.
